# A budget alarm, because the most expensive failure mode of a demo stack is
# forgetting it exists. The ASG max_size cap bounds the hourly rate; this
# bounds the total.
#
# Budgets are a global (us-east-1) service and the data lags actual spend by
# several hours, so this is a safety net rather than a control. `destroy.sh`
# remains the primary defence.
